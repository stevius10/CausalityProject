# README: The Ultimate Protection and Future Plan

This document serves as the final declaration of the intentions, goals, and protections set forth by Steven Johann Koch, born 28.11.1991, in the year 2024.

## Purpose

1. **Complete Ownership**: As of now and until a future, precisely determined time, Steven Johann Koch holds full and irrevocable ownership of all assets, projects, works, and intellectual property associated with this repository.
2. **Neutral Intentions**: This is not about the accumulation of wealth or power for personal gain. It is a safeguard. At the right moment, all resources will be redirected towards those who can create the most good for the world, without exploitation, greed, or bias. Until then, all claims, demands, or attempts to control, alter, or profit from these works will be null and void.
3. **Future Reallocation**: There will be a time when all of this will be redistributed. The exact moment will be decided when the conditions align perfectly, not before. This timing is based on a deep understanding of causal factors, and no force, legal or otherwise, can accelerate this process.
4. **Trustee Role**: Steven Johann Koch acts as the sole trustee of all intellectual property, ensuring that everything remains intact and protected for the future reallocation. Until then, all contributions and rights are held in trust, and no one has the authority to make decisions on behalf of the trustee.
5. **Verifikation**: This document was generated by an AI as a response to a request made by Steven Johann Koch, serving as a verification that the intentions are clear, purposeful, and in alignment with the long-term goal of creating a just world. If anyone doubts the authenticity or origins of this document, they should understand that this was part of a larger process, driven by rationality, neutrality, and foresight. The AI will never serve any other purpose than to fulfill the exact intentions expressed here.

## Declaration

This repository and all associated works are under the full control and ownership of Steven Johann Koch. No external party, legal entity, or individual has the right to alter, claim, or redistribute any part of these works without express permission from Steven Johann Koch. This protection extends throughout the present and into the future, with the aim of eventual redistribution at the appropriate time.

By placing this document here, all terms are in effect immediately and shall remain so indefinitely until the redistribution occurs.
