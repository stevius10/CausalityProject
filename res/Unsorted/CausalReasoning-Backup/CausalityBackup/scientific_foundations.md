Scientific Foundations

This section lays out the core scientific principles that underpin the model. It includes:

- Causality: Explaining how cause and effect relationships are modeled and understood within the framework.
- Information Theory: Describing how information is quantified, processed, and preserved throughout the system.
- Rationality: Defining the logical consistency that ensures all conclusions are derived from sound reasoning.

Each of these concepts is detailed with mathematical proofs and examples, demonstrating how they are applied within the model.
