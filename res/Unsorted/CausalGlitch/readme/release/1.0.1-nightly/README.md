# Causal Project - README

## Project Overview
Welcome to the **Causal Project** â€“ a venture aimed at understanding, simulating, and enhancing causal relationships in AI-driven decision-making. Our primary goal is to structure knowledge and problem-solving in ways that optimize causality-driven approaches.

## Infrastructure Setup
This project sets up a robust AWS infrastructure, leveraging services such as:
- **S3 Buckets**: General data storage and logging.
- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege access control.
- **KMS**: Secure key management and rotation.

This setup adheres to strict security principles while remaining highly modular and scalable for future needs.

## Quick Start Guide
To deploy the infrastructure:
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/stevius10/CausalProject.git
    ```
2. **Run the CloudFormation template**:
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://general-template.yaml --stack-name causal-infra
    ```

## Key Features
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and update for new features.
- **Security**: All resources are set with minimal privilege policies.
- **Automation**: CI/CD integration ready.
