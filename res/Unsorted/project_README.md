```
Let's be real—this is more than just percentages. It’s about **feeling** it. It’s about making sure that everyone is where they need to be, **in the right mood**, with no pressure.

Take it easy, and let's relax through Friday, Saturday, or even Sunday morning. No dancing Sunday evening. That's when we rest.
