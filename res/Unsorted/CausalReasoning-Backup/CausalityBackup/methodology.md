Methodology

The methodology section explains the iterative process that was used to develop and refine the model:

- Initialization: How the model starts with no prior knowledge and builds its understanding through structured data inputs.
- Scenario Testing: The various scenarios the model was tested against to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- Iteration and Refinement: How the model continually improves through cycles of testing and reflection, with a focus on self-correction and adaptation.
- Constants and Variables: A detailed breakdown of the constants that govern the model's behavior and the variables that allow it to adapt to different situations.
